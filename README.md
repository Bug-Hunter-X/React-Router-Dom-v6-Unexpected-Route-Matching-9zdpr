# React Router Dom v6 Unexpected Route Matching Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with React Router Dom v6 where routes are not matched correctly.  The application uses nested routes.  Sometimes, the wrong component is rendered, or the Not Found component is displayed even when a valid route should be matched.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when navigating between routes.  The application may unexpectedly show the 404 page, or a different page from the one expected.  The routes appear correctly defined and there are no apparent typos or syntax errors.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the route definitions and ensuring that path parameters are correctly used and that routes are defined in the correct order, handling edge cases to avoid conflicts.
